# EOL Rebaser Migration Configuration
#
# This file defines image migrations for bootc systems when images reach
# end of life (EOL). Each migration specifies a pattern to match deprecated
# images and the target image to migrate to.
#
# Configuration format:
# migrations:
#   - name: "Human readable migration name"
#     from_pattern: "regex pattern to match source images"
#     to_image: "target image to migrate to"
#     reason: "explanation for why this migration is needed"
#     effective_date: "YYYY-MM-DD when migration becomes active"

migrations:

    to_image: "ghcr.io/ublue-os/aurora-dx"
    reason: "ASUS-specific hardware enablement images are deprecated. The standard HWE image now includes all necessary drivers."
